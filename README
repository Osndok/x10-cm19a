X10 CM19A Kernel 2.6.12 Driver

Thank you for trying my driver!  It supports the X10 CM19A USB RF Transceiver.
To install, simply follow these steps:

1. Log in as 'root'
2. make
3. make install
4. modprobe x10-cm19a

Then, after plugging in your transceiver, you should see an entry such as /dev/cm19a0
representing your device.  Type 'modinfo x10-cm19a.ko' to obtain information about
supported module parameters.  To control your transceiver, format your commands as
described by these regular expressions:

[-+][a-p][01][1-9]

For example:
 - to turn on device c16: +c16
 - to turn off device d8: -d8
 - etc.

[udlrbs][a-p]

Ninja Pan'n'Tilt commands:
 u = up
 d = down
 l = left
 r = right

Lamp module commands:
 b = brighten
 s = soften

Enjoy!  Please send bug reports and patches to lemaymd at lemaymd dot com.

Special thanks goes to Neil Cherry of the Linux HA project for providing initial
USB interface code.
