* Usage:

x10mms [-v (verbose)] [-c alternate configuration file] [-d alternate device file]

This package contains source code for a couple of tools that
enable some basic functionality of the X10 CM19A RF transceiver.
The most important tool is x10mms.  It allows you to control
XMMS using an X10 CR12A camera control remote.  (A CR14A would
work as well, but has only 4 recognized buttons, rather than 16.)
To configure which functions are assigned to different keys, modify
x10mms.conf without disturbing its general format.  Then, close
any running instances of XMMS and start x10mms from the directory
where it was built.  Use and enjoy!

Key for functions listed in x10mms.conf:
aot_toggle	Toggle always-on-top (doesn't work yet)
balance_center	Perfectly center balance
balance_left	Shift balance left by 5%
balance_right	Shift balance right by 5%
decrease_volume	Decrease volume by 5%
eject		Eject media
exit		Close player and remote interface
increase_volume	Increase volume by 5%
pause		Pause
play		Play
play_pause	Play if currently paused, pause if currently playing
playlist_clear	Clear playlist
playlist_next	Play next song in playlist
playlist_prev	Play previous song in playlist
show_jump_box	Pop up jump-to box
show_prefs_box	Pop up the preferences box
stop		Stop
toggle_eq_win	Toggle equalizer visibility
toggle_main_win	Toggle main window visibility
toggle_pl_win	Toggle playlist visibility
toggle_repeat	Toggle playlist looping
toggle_shuffle	Toggle playlist randomization

* Installation:

I haven't taken the time to package this with autotools yet,
so it's just a raw Makefile right now.  Make sure you have
Boost, (http://www.boost.org/) libusb (http://libusb.sourceforge.net/)
and XMMS installed properly in standard directories.

Then, execute "make" and run the programs!  If you wish to manually install
each program, just copy them to somewhere in your path and don't forget
to specify the location of x10mms.conf on x10mms' command line.

* Credits:

Special thanks to Neil Cherry from Linux HA for his
personal assistance and the working code he provided.  I learned much!
He credits others, such as the javax.usb project for the special
init codes used to recognize particular remotes.
